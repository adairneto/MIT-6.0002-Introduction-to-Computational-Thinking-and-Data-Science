## Introduction

**Copenhagen Doctrine (Casual Nondeterminism):** At the most fundamental level, the behavior of the physical world cannot be predicted.

**Predictive nondeterminism:** We might treat the world as unpredictable because of our lack of knowledge.

**Stochastic Process:** An ongoing process where the next state might depend on both the previous states and some random element.

```python
import random
 
def rollDie():
    """returns a random int between 1 and 6"""
    return random.choice([1,2,3,4,5,6])
 
def testRoll(n = 10):
    result = ''
    for i in range(n):
        result = result + str(rollDie())
    print(result)
```

What is the probability of getting result = '11111' from `testRoll(5)`?

- Count the number of possible events.
- Count the number of events that have the property of interest.
- Divide one by another.
- Hence, $1/6^5 \approx 0.0001286$.

## Simple facts about probability

- Always in the range from 0 to 1.
- If the probability of an event is $p$, then the probability of it not occuring is $1-p$.
- When the events are **independent**, then the probability of all of these events occuring is the product of probabilities of each event.
- Two events are **independent** when the outcome of one does not influence the outcome of the other.

## Simulation of a Die Rolling

```python
random.seed(0)

def runSim(goal, numTrials, txt):
    total = 0
    for i in range(numTrials):
        result = ''
        for j in range(len(goal)):
            result += str(rollDie())
        if result == goal:
            total += 1
    print('Actual probability of', txt, '=',
          round(1/(6**len(goal)), 8)) 
    estProbability = round(total/numTrials, 8)
    print('Estimated Probability of', txt, '=',
          round(estProbability, 8))
    
#runSim('11111', 1000, '11111')
```

### How can we know the answer that got printed?

- **Pseudo-randoms:** starts with a seed by reading the clock of the computer.
- By using `random.seed(x)` we can determine the seed.

### Why did the simulation gave the wrong answer?

- It takes a lot of trials to get a good estimate.
- **Sample probability** is different from the **actual probability**.
- There was no need for simulation since we had a very close answer.
- Simulations can be very useful.

## The Birthday Problem

What is the probability of at least two people in a group having the same birthday?

If we have 367 people in the group? At least 1.

If every birthdate is equally likely, then it is:
$$
1 - \frac{366!}{366^N (366-N)!}
$$

```python
def sameDate(numPeople, numSame):
    possibleDates = range(366)
#    possibleDates = 4*list(range(0, 57)) + [58]\
#                    + 4*list(range(59, 366))\
#                    + 4*list(range(180, 270))
    birthdays = [0]*366
    for p in range(numPeople):
        birthDate = random.choice(possibleDates)
        birthdays[birthDate] += 1
    return max(birthdays) >= numSame

def birthdayProb(numPeople, numSame, numTrials):
    numHits = 0
    for t in range(numTrials):
        if sameDate(numPeople, numSame):
            numHits += 1
    return numHits/numTrials

import math

for numPeople in [10, 20, 40, 100]:
    print('For', numPeople,
          'est. prob. of a shared birthday is',
          birthdayProb(numPeople, 2, 10000))
    numerator = math.factorial(366)
    denom = (366**numPeople)*math.factorial(366-numPeople)
    print('Actual prob. for N = 100 =',
          1 - numerator/denom)
```

What about three people instead of two?

Complicated disjunct. A lot of possibilities.

But the simulation is pretty easy.

But all dates are not equally likely (see coments in the code above).

## Simulation Models

- A description of computations that provide usefulinformation about the possible behaviors of the systembeing modeled.
- It's descriptive, not prescriptive.
- It's an approximation of reality.

How can it be used?

- To model systems that are mathematically intractable.
- To extract useful intermediate results.
- Lend themselves to development by successive refinement and “what if” questions.
- Start by simulating random walks.
