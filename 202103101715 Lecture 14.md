## L1 and L2 Logistic Regression

Two majors to use logistic regression:

- L1 regression tends to drive one variable to zero.

- L2 (default) regression spreads weights across variables.

We can change the p cuttoff. But pay attention to the metrics.

## Receiver Operating Characteristic

- Look at all possible cuttoffs and watch its shape.

```python
def buildROC(trainingSet, testSet, title, plot = True):
    model = buildModel(trainingSet, True)
    xVals, yVals = [], []
    p = 0.0
    while p <= 1.0:
        truePos, falsePos, trueNeg, falseNeg =\
                               applyModel(model, testSet,
                               'Survived', p)
        xVals.append(1.0 - specificity(trueNeg, falsePos))
        yVals.append(sensitivity(truePos, falseNeg))
        p += 0.01
    auroc = sklearn.metrics.auc(xVals, yVals, True)
    if plot:
        pylab.plot(xVals, yVals)
        pylab.plot([0,1], [0,1])
        title = title + '\nAUROC = ' + str(round(auroc,3))
        pylab.title(title)
        pylab.xlabel('1 - specificity')
        pylab.ylabel('Sensitivity')
    return auroc
```

- Take the training set and test set.
- Build one model.
- Vary p.
- Apply model to different p's.
- Keep track of all those results.
- Plot 2D: sensitivity on y-axis, 1 - specificity on x-axis.
- Produce area under the curve `sklearn.metrics.auc`.

## Statistical Sins 

- Statistics about the data is not the same as the data.
- Use visualization tools to look at the data itself.
- Ask whether the things being compared are actually comparable.
- G.I.G.O. - Garbage In, Garbage Out.
- Analysis of bad data can lead to dangerous conclusions.
- Sampling:
  - All statistical techniques are based upon the assumption that by sampling a subset of a population we can infer things about the population as a whole.
  - If random sampling is used, one can make meaningful mathematical statements about the expected relation of the sample to the entire population.
  - Easy to get random samples in simulations.
  - Not so easy in the field, where some examples are more convenient to acquire than others.
- Non-representative Sampling:
  - "Convenience sampling" not usually random.
    - Survivor bias.
    - Non-response bias.
  - When samples not random and independent, we can still do things like means and standard deviations, but we should not draw conclusions from them using things like the empirical rule and central limit theorem.
- Understand how data was collected, and whether assumptions used in the analysis are satisfied. If not, be wary.
