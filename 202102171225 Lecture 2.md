# Lecture 2: Optimization Problems

Tags: #algorithms #python #efficiency #optimization

## Review greedy algorithm
- Easy to implement
- Efficient to run
- But does not always yield the best solution (how good is the approximation?)

Alternative: brute force algorithm
How to implement it?

## Search Tree
- Branch which was taken and which was not
- Until the bottom of the tree
- Apply it recursively
- Choose the node that has the best solution

Enumerates possibilites
Example: left-most, depth-most enumeration

### What is the complexity?
Look at the number of levels (= number of items to choose) and of nodes
At the level $i$ the number of nodes is $2^i$
Hence, if there are $n$ items, the number of nodes wil be:
$$
\sum_{i=0}^{n}2^i
$$
I.e. $O(2^{n+1})$
Possible optimization: do not look into possibilities that have more calories/weight than allowed, but does not change the complexity

```python
def maxVal(toConsider, avail):
    """Assumes toConsider a list of items, avail a weight
       Returns a tuple of the total value of a solution to the
         0/1 knapsack problem and the items of that solution"""
    if toConsider == [] or avail == 0:
        result = (0, ())
    elif toConsider[0].getCost() > avail:
        #Explore right branch only
        result = maxVal(toConsider[1:], avail)
    else:
        nextItem = toConsider[0]
        #Explore left branch
        withVal, withToTake = maxVal(toConsider[1:],
                                     avail - nextItem.getCost())
        withVal += nextItem.getValue()
        #Explore right branch
        withoutVal, withoutToTake = maxVal(toConsider[1:], avail)
        #Choose better branch
        if withVal > withoutVal:
            result = (withVal, withToTake + (nextItem,))
        else:
            result = (withoutVal, withoutToTake)
    return result
	
def testMaxVal(foods, maxUnits, printItems = True):
    print('Use search tree to allocate', maxUnits,
          'calories')
    val, taken = maxVal(foods, maxUnits)
    print('Total value of items taken =', val)
    if printItems:
        for item in taken:
            print('   ', item)

names = ['wine', 'beer', 'pizza', 'burger', 'fries',
         'cola', 'apple', 'donut', 'cake']
values = [89,90,95,100,90,79,50,10]
calories = [123,154,258,354,365,150,95,195]
foods = buildMenu(names, values, calories)

testGreedys(foods, 750)
print('')
testMaxVal(foods, 750)
```

```python
import random

def buildLargeMenu(numItems, maxVal, maxCost):
    items = []
    for i in range(numItems):
        items.append(Food(str(i),
                          random.randint(1, maxVal),
                          random.randint(1, maxCost)))
    return items

for numItems in (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45):
    print('Try a menu with', numItems, 'items')
    items = buildLargeMenu(numItems, 90, 250)
    testMaxVal(items, 750, False)  
```

## Recursive Fibonacci

```python
def fib(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
```

How to optimize? 

Creating a dictionary to store already computed values (*memoization*).

```python
def fastFib(n, memo = {}):
    """Assumes n is an int >= 0, memo used only by recursive calls
       Returns Fibonacci of n"""
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    try:
        return memo[n]
    except KeyError:
        result = fastFib(n-1, memo) + fastFib(n-2, memo)
        memo[n] = result
        return result
```

When memoization works?

**Optimal substructure:** combines optimal solution to local problems, generating a global optimal solution

**Overlapping subproblems:** finding an optimal solutions involves solving the same problem multiple times

Back to the knapsack problem:

Add a memo as a third argument to MaxVal:

```python
def fastMaxVal(toConsider, avail, memo = {}):
    """Assumes toConsider a list of subjects, avail a weight
         memo supplied by recursive calls
       Returns a tuple of the total value of a solution to the
         0/1 knapsack problem and the subjects of that solution"""
    if (len(toConsider), avail) in memo:
        result = memo[(len(toConsider), avail)]
    elif toConsider == [] or avail == 0:
        result = (0, ())
    elif toConsider[0].getCost() > avail:
        #Explore right branch only
        result = fastMaxVal(toConsider[1:], avail, memo)
    else:
        nextItem = toConsider[0]
        #Explore left branch
        withVal, withToTake =\
                 fastMaxVal(toConsider[1:],
                            avail - nextItem.getCost(), memo)
        withVal += nextItem.getValue()
        #Explore right branch
        withoutVal, withoutToTake = fastMaxVal(toConsider[1:],
                                                avail, memo)
        #Choose better branch
        if withVal > withoutVal:
            result = (withVal, withToTake + (nextItem,))
        else:
            result = (withoutVal, withoutToTake)
    memo[(len(toConsider), avail)] = result
    return result

def testMaxVal(foods, maxUnits, algorithm, printItems = True):
    print('Menu contains', len(foods), 'items')
    print('Use search tree to allocate', maxUnits,
          'calories')
    val, taken = algorithm(foods, maxUnits)
    if printItems:
        print('Total value of items taken =', val)
        for item in taken:
            print('   ', item)
```

Number of possible values of toConsider bounded by len(items)

Possible values of avail a bit harder to characterize: bounded by number of distinct sums of weights

- Greedy algorithm often provide adequate (though not necessarly optimal) solutions
- Finding an optimal solution is usually exponentially hard
- Dynamic programming often yields good results
