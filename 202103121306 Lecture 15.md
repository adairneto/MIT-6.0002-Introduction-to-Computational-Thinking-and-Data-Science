# Lecture 15: Statistical Sins and Wrap Up

- Truncate the y-axis to eliminate preposterous values.
- Don't confuse fluctuations with trends.
- Chose an interval consistent with the thing that is being considered.
- Cherry picking.
- Beware of percentage change when you donâ€™t know the denominator.

## Hypothetical Case

```python
random.seed(0)
numCasesPerYear = 36000
numYears = 3
stateSize = 10000
communitySize = 10
numCommunities = stateSize//communitySize

numTrials = 100
numGreater = 0
for t in range(numTrials):
    locs = [0]*numCommunities
    for i in range(numYears*numCasesPerYear):
        locs[random.choice(range(numCommunities))] += 1
    if locs[111] >= 143:
        numGreater += 1
prob = round(numGreater/numTrials, 4)
print('Est. probability of region 111 having at least 143 cases =', prob)

anyRegion = 0
for trial in range(numTrials):
    locs = [0]*numCommunities
    for i in range(numYears*numCasesPerYear):
        locs[random.choice(range(numCommunities))] += 1
    if max(locs) >= 143:
        anyRegion += 1
print(anyRegion)
aProb = round(anyRegion/numTrials, 4)
print('Est. probability of some region  having at least 143 cases =', aProb)
```

- Variant of cherry picking called multiple hypothesis testing.

## Wrap Up the Course

- Optimization Problems
  - Many problems can be formulated in terms of:
    - Objective function
    - Set of constraints
  - Greedy algorithms often useful
    - But may not find optimal solution
  - Many optimization problems inherently exponential
    - But dynamic programming often works
    - And memoization a generally useful technique
  - Examples: knapsack problem, graph problems, curve fitting, clustering
- Stochastic Thinking
  - The world is (predictably) non-deterministic
  - Thinking in terms of probabilities is often useful
  - Randomness is a powerful tool for building computations that model the world
  - Random computations useful even when for problems that do not involve randomness (e.g. integration)
- Modeling aspects of the world
  - Models always inaccurate
    - Provide abstractions of reality
  - Deterministic models, e.g. graph theoretic
  - Statistical models
    - Simulation models: Monte Carlo
    - Models based on sampling
      - Characterizing accuracy is critical
      - Central limit theorem
      - Empirical rule
    - Machine Learning
      - Supervised
      - Unsupervised
  - Presentation of data
    - Plotting
    - Good and bad practices
- Becoming a better programmer
  - Exposure to a few extra features of Python and some useful libraries
  - Practice, practice, practice
